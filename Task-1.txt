Create separate route tables for public and private subnets.

Set up one ECS cluster in private subnets. setup appropriate scaling at the cluster level and service level.
Deploy any backend service which has simple GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE APIs in your ECS cluster. You need to create 2 containers of this backend service. One will run on EC2 and one will run on Fargate.
These backend containers should be running behind aws ALB. All the GET requests should be forwarded to the container running on Fargate.
Use RDS as the database service to store the data. RDS should be on private subnets.
Use a private ECR registry to store the docker images.
Service containers should use AWS Secret Manager to read database credentials.
Set up a simple Frontend with the help of Cloudfront and S3. Frontend will use your backend APIs to interact with Database.
Set up appropriate alerts and monitoring on your infra. Use AWS Cloudwatch to store backend service logs.
Acceptance Criteria:
 You should follow additional Security best practices (cloud as well as container images) while taking cloud infra cost into account.
 Tag each cloud resource appropriately. (Name tag must be present).
 The application should be running between 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM.
